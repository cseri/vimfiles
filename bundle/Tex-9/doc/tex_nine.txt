    TeX 9 is a ftplugin that enhances significantly the writing experience of
    high quality documents with LaTeX and Vim. The scope of TeX 9 is to rely
    first and foremost on features that are already available in Vim and try
    to keep things as simple and snappy as possible. 
    
    Most of TeX 9 is implemented in Python (2.6, 2.7) and therefore a Vim
    installation with Python support is required.  In addition, TeX 9 depends
    on the matchit plugin (>= 1.13.2) by Benji Fisher. Matchit is shipped with
    the standard installation of Vim but it is also bundled with TeX 9 for
    convenience. 

     The main features of TeX 9 are
        * Compile, debug and view documents from within Vim
        * Insert LaTeX code snippets with ease
        * Select-objects for inline maths and maths environments
        * Omni-completion of BibTeX database entries and label references
        * Filetype specific indentation (courtesy of Johannes Tanzler)
        * LaTeX2e manual (ported to Vim by Mikolaj Machowski)
        * No-hassle settings, relatively few mappings

    Shoutouts
        * Carl Mueller, this ftplugin was inspired by his `auctex.vim' script
        * Vim-LaTeX people Srinath Avadhanula, Mikolaj Machowski and Benji Fisher

==============================================================================

1.  Installation                                    *tex_nine-installation*

    TeX 9 is distributed as a gzipped tarball. Unzip it to your local runtime
    path, usually `~/.vim/'. All TeX 9 specific files referred in this help
    file are located under `ftplugin/TeX_9'. 

    Note! In your vimrc, it's mandatory to set `g:tex_flavor' to the compiler
    you wish to use or otherwise TeX 9 might not be loaded at all. Other settings
    you may want to tweak are:

    g:tex_viewer  
        *   Vim dictionary with entries 'app' and 'target'.
        *   Default: {'app': 'xdg-open', 'target': 'pdf'}

    g:tex_bibfiles
        *   Vim list that enumerates the BibTeX databases you want to use
        *   You need only to specify the name of your database if the file 
            resides under a valid texmf tree, i.e. under
            `$TEXMFHOME/bibtex/bib/', or in the compilation folder.
            Alternatively, you may specify the whole path.
        *   Default: Disabled

    g:tex_verbose
        *   Boolean
        *   If set to 1, TeX 9 doesn't attempt to filter irrelevant
            warning messages that LaTeX compilers produce. Error messages
            are gathered in a ||quickfix|| list that you may access by
            typing <LocalLeader>Q in normal mode.
        *   Default: Error messages are filtered.

    g:tex_cycle_delimeters
        *   Boolean
        *   If set to 0, delimiters ({, [, (, $) are not automatically
            completed.
        *   Default: Delimiters are completed.

    Example vimrc for old school latex users: >

        let g:tex_flavor = 'latex'
        let g:tex_viewer = {'app': 'xdvi', 'target': 'dvi'}
<
    Another one for a XeLaTeX user that has multiple BibTeX databases: >

        let g:tex_flavor = 'xelatex'
        let g:tex_bibfiles = ['main.bib', '~/thesis/ad_hoc.bib']
<
    Before you start typesetting documents, you may want to customize the
    document template file `tex_skeleton.tex' in the `skeleton' directory.
    The dynamic content in the header can be safely erased if you don't want
    it. The file `tex_skeleton.tex.xelatex' shows the skeleton file that the
    author is currently using.

    Finally, should you want to disable TeX 9 temporarily, put this in
    your vimrc: >

        au BufReadPre *.tex let b:init_tex_nine = 1
<

==============================================================================

2.  Basics                                          *tex_nine-basics*

    In an empty LaTeX manuscript, press <F1> to insert a skeleton of a
    document. Almost all other TeX 9 mappings are prefixed with
    |maplocalleader| that defaults to semi-colon, `;'. Typing `;a' would
    result in `\alpha' for instance. See |tex_nine-mappings| below for a
    complete listing. To insert the actual character that <LocalLeader> was
    set to, type <LocalLeader><LocalLeader>.

    The following mappings work in insert mode. Use <LocalLeader>C to insert a
    citation, i.e. `\cite{citekey}'. You're prompted with a popup list of
    citekeys if you set `g:tex_bibfiles'. You can keep on inserting citations
    inside the curly braces as long as you separate them with commas.
    References, `\ref{ref}', work in a similar way: the corresponding mapping
    is <LocalLeader>R. Label search is performed only in the current buffer.

    To insert an environment, press <LocalLeader>B. You're prompted for an
    environment name and if a corresponding LaTeX code snippet was defined, it
    is inserted into the manuscript. Finally, should you forget the name of a
    standard LaTeX command, type <LocalLeader>K for dictionary completion, or
    should you need advice on LaTeX, consult the LaTeX2e manual with `:help
    latex'.

    You may compile the document in normal mode. <LocalLeader>k, `small
    compile', compiles your document once and doesn't bother about references;
    <LocalLeader>K, `big compile', calls additionally bibtex and should get
    the cross-references right. You're informed about potential errors: to go
    over them open the ||quickfix|| list with <LocalLeader>Q. Typing
    <LocalLeader>V should open the document in your system's default PDF
    viewer, if you didn't set `g:tex_viewer' to something else. 

==============================================================================

3.  Snippets                                        *tex_nine-snippets*

    When you want to insert a LaTeX snippet with <LocalLeader>B, notice that
    the input prompt is <Tab>-completable. Your input is matched against words
    in `dictionaries/tex_dictionary.txt'. Once entered, the name of the
    environment is matched against keywords in the file
    `snippets/tex_snippets.snippets'. Matching snippets are inserted.
    Otherwise TeX 9 inserts a generic environment in LaTeX manuscripts and
    raises an error in BibTeX files.
    >
        % Generic environment
        \begin{keyword}

        \end{keyword}
<
    You may extend the snippet file with your own environments and you will
    notice that the syntax bears resemblance with Michael Sander's snipMate
    plugin (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540). TeX 9
    leaves the <Tab> key untouched so that you may still resort to snipMate if
    you so prefer. If your custom environments is not included in
    `tex_dictionary.txt', append it there. >
            
        :cd ~/.vim/ftplugin/TeX_9/dictionaries
        :!echo 'new_environment' >> tex_dictionary.txt
<
==============================================================================

4.  BibTeX                                          *tex_nine-bibtex*

    In addition to citekey completion, TeX 9 provides a couple of features
    that make it easier to work with BibTeX and LaTeX files in the same Vim
    session. You may take a quick peek at a particular BibTeX entry by
    pressing `gb' over its citekey, i.e. \cite{citekey}. This command is in
    line with ||gd|| and  |gf| with the exception that the BibTeX entry is
    shown in a preview window (see |preview-window|).

    You may add new databases on the fly by redefining `g:tex_bibfiles' and
    pressing <LocalLeader>U in normal mode. This mapping updates the citekey
    list that TeX 9 uses for completion. Remember to redefine the
    `\bibliography' command accordingly. TeX 9 doesn't bother to check it at
    all to avoid problems when viewing others' LaTeX manuscripts.

==============================================================================

5.  SyncTeX                                         *tex_nine-synctex*
    
    TeX 9 1.1.6 drops SyncTeX support temporarily because lately there has
    been some serious breakage in _all_ the components that are required for
    this feature. To wit:

        *   Vim cannot use `python-dbus' if compiled with both the Python 3 and
            Python 2.x interpreters.
        *   SyncTeX itself is broken in my TeXlive 2011 distribution. This bug
            has been fixed (http://www.tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2011-September/030170.html).

    We'll get back to SyncTeXing when the dust settles.

==============================================================================

6.  Mappings                                        *tex_nine-mappings*

    <LocalLeader> is semi-colon by default. Change the value of
    'maplocalleader' in `ftplugin/TeX_9/tex_nine_common.vim' to suit your
    taste.

6.1 Insert mode >

        <LocalLeader><LocalLeader>          <LocalLeader>
        <LocalLeader>K                      Dictionary completion
        <LocalLeader>C                      Insert a citation
        <LocalLeader>B                      Insert an environment

6.4 Extras

    The usual inner paragraph, |ip|, text object is revamped to handle
    equations. Press 'vip' anywhere inside a maths environment to
    highlight its contents. The outer paragraph alternative, |ap| includes
    the delimiting lines that contain `\\(begin|end)'. In addition, you
    may easily operate on in-line maths, e.g.  `$E=mc^{2}$', with the the
    text objects `i$' and `a$', inner and outer equation.
    
    TeX 9 completes dollar signs, parens, brackets and curly braces. In
    similar vein, type '^^' to insert '^{}', '__' to insert '_{}', '~~' to
    insert '\approx' and '==' to insert aligned equation sign '&='. 

    Try omni-completion () inside curly braces when you're including a
    picture with `\includegraphics{}' or when you're setting your font with
    the `fontspec' package, i.e. `\setmainfont{}'. You'll get a listing of
    pictures in the compilation folder in the first case and a list of
    installed font on your system in the latter. Supported picture formats are
    EPS, PDF, JPG and PNG.

7.  Tips and trick                                  *tex_nine-tips*

7.1     Extending TeX 9: Custom template files

        You can create your own macros/mappings and enable them by placing
        them in a file that is located in the ftplugin directory and whose
        filename is prefixed with `tex', e.g. `~/.vim/ftplugin/tex_foobar.vim'. 

        You may, for example, create more template files for different
        documentclasses and insert them in your manuscripts with a mapping.

        Define the path to your custom template file in the file of your
        choice. >

                let b:mytemp = 'path/to/it/skeleton.tex'
<
        and map <F2> for instance to do the insertion in normal mode. >
                
                noremap <buffer> <F2> :call tex_nine#Insert_skeleton(b:mytemp)<CR>

7.2     Extending TeX 9: Shortcuts for snippets

        Similarly, you may want to create shortcuts for snippet insertion if
        you don't want to use <LocalLeader>B all the time.

        An example for mapping <F1> to insert an equation snippet: >
                
                inoremap <buffer><expr> <F1> tex_nine#Insert_snippet('equation')
<
        If you come up with something sweet, please drop me a line (email
        address behind a reCAPTCHA in the README file.).

7.3     Spell checking

        If you've enabled 'modeline', you may conveniently activate spell
        checking in your LaTeX manuscripts by editing the modeline in the
        template file.

        Example for anglophones: >

                % vim:tw=66 sw=2 ft=tex spell spelllang=en
<
        Notice that newer versions of Vim provide an option >

                let g:tex_comment_nospell= 1

<       for disabling spell checking of comments that otherwise get messed up
        pretty badly.

7.4     Remove temporary TeX files
    
        To delete the temporary files that LaTeX compilers produce, use
        shell/Vim expansions like so: >

                !rm %<.{aux,bbl,toc,log}
<
7.5     Folding

        With newer versions of Vim it's easy as >

                let g:tex_fold_enabled = 1
<
7.6     Alternate command line switches 
        
        By default, TeX 9 compiles your document with the following command:
>
            g:tex_flavor -file-line-error -interaction=nonstopmode %
<
        If you need to specify some other switches on the fly, compile your
        document with Vim's |make| command. An example when a LaTeX package
        needs to call external applications:
>
            :silent make! -shell-escape %:p
<
